###### Summary
The movie database is a sample class project.  The database enables users to select from a short catalog of movies to then view that specific title's information as well as see a short list of cast members (not all inclusive).  By selecting an actor's name from the cast or director name the user can see personal information about that individual as well as all the films (within the database) that they have played a character or directed.

###### Technology
Using PHP 7 with AWS EC2 and RDS.  Code written in VS Code and loaded to RDS via FTP.
